#Liars Dice
Liars dice is an intiguing dice game that's oddly similar to poker. The rules are similar,...

The simple gameplay of liars dice invites complex strategy, due to the ever changing information dynamics. In game theory, Liars Dice would be labeled an asymetric game. Similar to poker, oppenents have differing amounts, and quality, of information at any given time. Unlike a game like chess, where all game state is visible to all players, the decisions made in Liars Dice require making guesses about hidden information.

As you might have been able to pick up from the name, Liars Dice requires some amount of bluffing. If only bid aggresively representing the dice in your hand, you'll be able to rope in rounds when your oppoenent invevitably calles you- but after multiple hands against a diligent oppenent they will take note, and become more and more unlikely to call you. On the flip side, if you only ever lie about the dice you hold, you will quickly start to get called often. This isn't just a broad strategy note, it applies to indiviudal hands as well. If you always bluff 6's with low rolls, you gifting your oppenent an unnecesary edge. All of these strategys would be considered a "Pure Strategy", and in a game like liars dice, are open to exploitation.

In order to play defencively against your opponent, multiple actions must be considered. The "ideal" decision cannot get choosen every time, it must be balanced by some frequency of suboptimal plays. This is what game theory calles a "Mixed Strategy". A mixed strategy dictates probabilities to act on a range of actions, for any given state. Compared to a Pure Strategy, where with a given input a player will always have a discrete output, a mixed strategy often won't gaurentee a specific output for any given input.  
# GTO
The holy grail of Texas Hold'em play is a mathmatically derived Mixed Strategy dubbed "Game Theory Optimal", or GTO. "GTO Poker" describes a theoretial strategy that when played perfectly, is mathmatically unexploitable- Over infinite hands, you could never lose money, no matter how adaptable your opponent is to your strategy.  In practice, GTO play can be thought of as playing though a function: "Input" the table state, "output" a list of actions, some of which are likely than others. Now, im sure you're wondering: If you can't lose money playing GTO, why doesn't everyone play GTO? Well, going back to the "Theoretical" designation  I gave GTO, it's pretty fucking hard to always play. Playing perfect GTO is no different than always knowing the perfect chess move. Even for the great Magnus, this is a pretty steep feat. While always sticking to GTO is impossible, we can still adapt concepts into our play.

So.... how? In order to keep this article light, we can look at positions with a smaller number of variables. In poker, this most tanslates to pre-flop strategy, which represents your first action after looking at your 2 hole cards. A good preflop player can boil the table state into 3 variables: Cards, Position, and incoming action, and act accordingly. For example, being 1st to act (Also called Under The Gun), with a suited K8, we'd raise 87.5% of the time, and fold the other 12.5% of the time. If we we're sitting in cuttoff, which has a later action, we would raise that hand 100% of the time! In fact, even if we got dealt K3 suited (A noticably worse hand), we would still raise 100% of the time in that position! Model this function across every possible hand you could be dealt, and you end up with a GTO preflop strategy. Visualized, it looks something like this.  

If we can model this in a game like Poker, could we do something similar in Liars Dice?
# Nash Equilibrium
If we look at GTO in terms of broader game theory, we could classify it as a Nash Equilibirum. Nash Equilibrium's occur in games when opponents know each other's strategies, and still have nothing to gain from changing their own strategy. In essence, even assuming your oppenent completely understands your strategy, there exists no strategy to take advantage of you; Leaving them with... the exact same strategy. Now, using Nash Equilibriums to describe poker, it formalizes my previous explaination of GTO being "Unexploitable". Even if your oppenent knows you play perfect GTO, their best option is to do the exact same thing, in which case you will come out dramatically... even (thus, the "equilibrium" part). However, i'll again emphasize that this is theory in a vacuum. Nobody plays perfect GTO poker, and we gain our advantage by aiming to be unepxloitable, while exploiting our opponents. While conceptual poker can be solved to an equilibrium, any actual game of poker is very far from it.

Understanding these concepts can lead to advantages in poker, but what about Liars Dice? More specifically, does Liars Dice have a Nash Equilibrium? 

The quick answer is yes. For any game with finite actions(Check), there must exist atleast one Equilibrium. John Nash proved this in his 1951 article "Non-Cooperative Games", thus the name.
