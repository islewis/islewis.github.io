#Liars Dice
Liars dice is an intiguing dice game that's oddly similar to poker. The rules are similar,...

The simple gameplay of liars dice invites complex strategy, due to the ever changing information dynamics. In game theory, Liars Dice would be labeled an asymetric game. Similar to poker, oppenents have differing amounts, and quality, of information at any given time. Unlike a game like chess, where all game state is visible to all players, the decisions made in Liars Dice require making guesses about hidden information.

As you might have been able to pick up from the name, Liars Dice requires some amount of bluffing. If only bid aggresively representing the dice in your hand, you'll be able to rope in rounds when your oppoenent invevitably calles you- but after multiple hands against a diligent oppenent they will take note, and become more and more unlikely to call you. On the flip side, if you only ever lie about the dice you hold, you will quickly start to get called often. This isn't just a broad strategy note, it applies to indiviudal hands as well. If you always bluff 6's with low rolls, you gifting your oppenent an unnecesary edge. All of these strategys would be considered a "Pure Strategy", and in a game like liars dice, are open to exploitation.

In order to play defencively against your opponent, multiple actions must be considered. The "ideal" decision cannot get choosen every time, it must be balanced by some frequency of suboptimal plays. This is what game theory calles a "Mixed Strategy". A mixed strategy dictates probabilities to act on a range of actions, for any given state. Compared to a Pure Strategy, where with a given input a player will always have a discrete output, a mixed strategy often won't gaurentee a specific output for any given input.  
# GTO
The holy grail of Texas Hold'em play is a mathmatically derived Mixed Strategy dubbed "Game Theory Optimal", or GTO. "GTO Poker" describes a theoretial strategy that when played perfectly, is mathmatically unexploitable- Over infinite hands, you could never lose money, no matter how your oppenent played or adapted to your strategy.  In practice, GTO play can be thought of as playing though a function: "Input" the table state, "output" a list of actions, some of which are likely than others. However, if you cannot ever lose money playing GTO, why doesn't everyone just play GTO? Well, it might be a bit more difficult than you think. Doing some quick math, we can see how many possible game states exist for a 9-seated game of Texas holdem.

Simple. All you need to play well
