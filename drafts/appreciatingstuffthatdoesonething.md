## Appreciating stuff that only does one thing
Barber shop arcade machine- computer that literally only does one thing. Plays one game. It would be easy to emulate the game on my computer, but the magic would be lost. Not sure entirely what the magic is, but it seems to be a mix of the single use computer, in additation with the dedicated form factor. The only thing that is important is the game, which makes it more enjoyable for someone using it. Also, with no other distractions, everything is able to priporotize game usage. The handle can be the perfect handle, the buttons can be in the perfect layout. Engineering is a game of tradeoffs. Having a single focus allows for total alignment over these tradeoffs. 

Now, id be able to emulate that game on my computer, emulate it on my steam deck, or even create an all new arcade with a rpi that could run any old game! But none of those sound interesting or fun! 

Other examples wouldbe 

Anti Swiss Army knife. The more focus is distributed between multiple prioroties, the less you can trust a single one. A dedicated screwdriver will have more thought put behind it than one in a swiss army knife. While there still is value in multi use tools, you lose agility by using one.

Platforms are the ideal techical solution, but might not be the best engineering solution. Platforms that allow you to wire together individual modules are flexible, allowing for the best tool for the job, but also powerful, allowing you to choose the best dedicated tool. This comes with an overhead, although. With an unopnionated platform design that I described, someone must be opinionated, which takes time. It takes time to choose the tools, it takes time to learn the tools, and it takes time to maintain the tools.

"Doing one thing" is a spectrum. Vim is a only a text editor, but could also be considered a platform bc plugins. Barely any software literally only do "one thing" in the same sense that a screwdriver, or a hammer does. In the same vein, if I was a carpenter I wouldn't want a "swiss army knife" tool that did everything I needed- I would want a screwdriver, and a hammer, and a measuring tape. 

You cannot get rid of complexity, you can only move it around
